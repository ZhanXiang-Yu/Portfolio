The visual aspect of the site is designed using WebFlow, hence some of the Webflow variables and setup.

The original plan is to add more assent elements, effects of clicking on options, and overall effects. The execution of the plan is pushed to a later date given I do not know much JavaScript at all. Maybe in the future.

The organization of different tags in the html file can definitely done better. Same for many CCS class formats. Pretty sure a lot of those are not used.
